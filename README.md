## About me

More than 8+ years experience in software development, I made a large number of successful projects in the web and desktop. Inspired in learning new technologies and business opportunities.

Despite coding, I’m a big fan of architecture talks, design patterns, best practices and subjects like Agile, TDD and cloud computing, tests, user expierience. Searching for opportunities to join qn engaged and commited team, passionate for its own product, creating life-changing experiences. A group that shares the same passion about coding craftsmanship with great product vision. 

Yet, I have a blog where I share some progress on my personal projects and other interesting resources. l believe in open source initiative and share most of my work that has no impact in business secrets. You can find it on my GitHub account.
